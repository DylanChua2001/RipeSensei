# RipeSensei

Every year, a lot of food is thrown away because of spoilage. Just last year alone, 3.37k metric tons of food waste was generated by NTUC FairPrice supermarket alone. Our project, RipeSensei, aims to reduce this humongous food wastage by preemptively identifying food that is on the verge of spoiling.

Through this, supermarket can use the data collected to effectively price vegetables according to their freshness. RipeSensei aims to do that by measuring a variety of gases (Ethylene, Ammonia, Methane and other Metal Oxide gases). This data is further supplemented with imagery data from camera to better predict the stage of food ripening. Furthermore, we will also measure food storage conditions (Temperature and Humidity) to prolong food freshness.
